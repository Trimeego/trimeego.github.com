## Where Do I start

Recently, I was asked "What programming language should i learn as a beginner?".  Perhaps life was easier when I started prgramming.  The answers were easier, ince expectations were less.  Basic and Logo were where I cut my teeth.  Visual Basic was perhaps the world's most accessible beginners language if you were on windows and Hypercard (ok, maybe not a programming language in some people's minds) was awesome on the Mac.

I found that, despite the fact that I have put applications into production in over a dozen languages, I could not answer the question without a **lot** more information.  Basic, Logo and Visual Basic are eliminataed outright, but where to go from there?  I had to ask the question: "What do you want to do with it?"
